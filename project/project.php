					Up and Away is a DLC-esque mod, adding an entire new world to explore. To get started, you must find the Shopkeeper, a suspicious fellow who will spawn along brick roads during the rain. There is where your quest begins! There are many new items, mechanics, creatures, and more! Conquer a world where winter never ends, and night never begins! The new world is not without weather, however.

						The mod is currently in Alpha, and so there may exist bugs and incompatibilities with other mods. If you find any, do report it, as fixing any possible issues is a priority. Feedback is welcome and encouraged!
</p>
<p>
						You know, you're a hard worker. Life in this desolate land is tough. You've got to fight to survive, scratching out a living in the dirt, clinging on by whatever means necessary. Just hoping that tomorrow will come.



						What if I told you there was more than this out there? That right above your head, up there in the sky there was a whole new world? A paradise unlike any other.



						Would you like to see it?



						I ask very little of you. For a small sum, a kingdom can be yours. The very land you tread is as soft as any mattress. There's food wherever you look. A veritable buffet of the sweetest treats you'll ever enjoy.



						Doesn't that sound good?



						Animals of all shapes and sizes will flock to you. Weird and wondrous sights a-plenty. What about a giant mushroom? What about a giant mushroom made entirely of jelly? There's all that and more.
</p>

<p>
						You don't have to stay here, jumping at shadows and living off bark. I shall wait for you on the road as rain falls. Come, come find me and I'll give you your freedom.
</p>
